staging area is a temp buffer before you really commit your modification to current branch.

I can make sure I have only one logical change in staging area.

git diff command will present difference between working directory and staging area.

git diff --satged will present difference bewtween staging area and repository(most recently commit)

If I have to fix bug or experiment on something, I could create git branch

                                       ----First pass at                                              adding coins-- 
                                      /  
---Fix typo in sapce --Revert Control/---I can't spell screen apparently--....Add "this.delayBeforeBullet = 10;" on Line 424--\

       \---easy mode
